# Project Name: Flutter Localization with Persistence

## Description
This Flutter project demonstrates how to implement localization (supporting multiple languages) with persistence, allowing users to select their preferred language and have the app remember their choice across sessions.

## Features
1. **Localization Support:** The app supports multiple languages, including English and one additional language (e.g., Spanish, French, German).
2. **Language Selection:** Users can choose their preferred language from a list of available languages.
3. **Persistence:** The selected language preference is persisted locally, ensuring that the app remembers the user's choice across sessions.
4. **Easy Integration:** The project demonstrates a straightforward integration of localization and persistence, making it easy for developers to implement similar functionality in their Flutter apps.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Flutter installed. If not, follow the instructions on [Flutter's official website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
3. Navigate to the project directory and run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies.
4. Run the app on an emulator or physical device using `flutter run`.
